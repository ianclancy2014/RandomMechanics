# RandomMechanics
This repository will be for my random mechanics I'm working on

ThirdBroGameboy.js is the framework for a mechanic that determines how many hours in a day a third brother will get to play on the gameboy, but I plan on having it on hand to pull from for other projects. The intenion behind it is to have something that tracks use based on priority, and is easy for me to visualize (every brother gets to decide if hey use the gameboy and age has priority). I plan on adding things like letting the user determine how many hours each person gets, and just how much age gives each brother priority.
